This is still research. Not clear how any of the above products will meaningfully contribute to environmental decision making. 2) Participation of PIs and inclusion of MBON indicator data and synthesis in NOAA IEAs\n\n\n\nAudience for whom are we generating these indicators and products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other audience / users or details of above that are important to consider?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other industries or details of above that are important to consider?\n\njeffrey.runge@maine.edu\nNot clear how indicator data would be used by industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other initiatives or details of above that are important to consider?\n\nchris.kelble@noaa.gov\nAmerica the Beautiful is just the US name for 30 x 2030.

Hodgepodge data where you have an observation here and there introduces a lot of biases that we would need to have a robust method to correct for.\njeffrey.runge@maine.edu\nAbundance of key species contributing to trophic structure and function or to species with cultural value (e.g.Â whales)\n\n\n\nPortals to distribute indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other portals or details of above that are important to consider?\n\nchris.kelble@noaa.gov\nI think this depends on the indicator developed and its scale.\njeffrey.runge@maine.edu\nIOOS regional associations, NOAA IEA"
